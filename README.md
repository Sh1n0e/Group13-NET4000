## Project 

We will be doing Project 7 "Learning-Based Traffic Classification Using In-Kernel eBPF Features"

Question: How accurate can traffic classification be using only in-kernel features available to eBPF programs?

## Description

Exploring lightweight ML-based traffic classification using features observable at eBPF hook points without deep packet inspection.

## Expected Experiments 
- Extract flow features via eBPF 
- Train ML classifiers offline 
- Deploy classifiers offline 
- Deploy classifiers for online inference 
- Measure classification accuracy and overhead

## Expected Results 
- Accuracy vs overhead trade-offs
- Feature importance analysis 
- Comparison with user-space classifiers
